# Architecture

cubeplane is a Cargo workspace of small, single-responsibility crates plus a
Bun/TypeScript admin panel. Data flows in one direction at each boundary, which
keeps the pieces independently testable.

## Crates

### `cubeplane-protocol`
Runtime-agnostic wire primitives for protocol 763: VarInt/VarLong, the
`ProtoRead`/`ProtoWrite` extension traits over `bytes::Buf`/`BufMut`,
`Encode`/`Decode` packet traits, and the `State` enum (handshaking → status /
login → play). No async, no I/O.

### `cubeplane-nbt`
A complete Named Binary Tag implementation (all 12 tag types) with binary
(de)serialization and a fluent `Nbt` builder. Used for the Login registry codec
and chunk heightmaps. `Compound` uses a `BTreeMap` so generated NBT is
deterministic.

### `cubeplane-world`
- `block`: curated 1.20.1 block-state id registry with name lookup.
- `chunk`: 16×384×16 columns of paletted sections, `MOTION_BLOCKING`
  heightmaps, full-skylight light data, and the exact paletted-container wire
  encoding the client expects.
- `gen`: a `Generator` trait with superflat and value-noise terrain
  implementations (no external dependencies).
- `World`: lazy chunk generation/caching and global block get/set.

### `cubeplane-mods`
The QuickJS mod runtime. The context lives on its own OS thread; the engine
sends `ModEvent`s in and receives `ModAction`s out over channels. JS state
(handlers, commands) lives on the JS heap, so Rust just exchanges JSON across
the boundary — no lifetime gymnastics. See [MODDING.md](./MODDING.md).

### `cubeplane-server`
The engine proper:
- `codec`: async VarInt framing with zlib compression.
- `ids` / `clientbound` / `serverbound`: packet ids and (de)serializers.
- `registry`: the dimension/biome/chat-type Login codec.
- `connection`: the per-connection handshake → status/login → play lifecycle,
  chunk streaming, movement relay, chat, commands and building.
- `state`: the `Arc<Shared>` everything hangs off — config, world, player
  table, broadcast helpers, the mod bridge.
- `control`: the HTTP + WebSocket admin API (axum).
- `lib`: `run()` boots the world, mods, the 20 TPS game loop, the control API
  and the accept loop.

### `cubeplane`
The binary: config loading, tracing setup, banner, graceful Ctrl-C shutdown.

## Concurrency model

- One Tokio task per connection. Reads happen in that task; writes go through an
  unbounded channel to a dedicated per-connection writer task, so broadcasts
  from other tasks never block a reader.
- Shared mutable state is a single `Arc<Shared>`. The world is behind a
  `Mutex` (held only for brief, synchronous chunk/block operations — never
  across an `.await`). The player table is an `RwLock<HashMap>`.
- The mod runtime is single-threaded QuickJS on its own OS thread, fed by
  channels. Mod actions are applied by a dedicated async task.
- A 20 TPS game loop drives world time, keep-alives and per-second mod ticks.

## Testing

- Unit tests in each crate (VarInt/NBT roundtrips, chunk packing, generation,
  config).
- An end-to-end mod test drives a real QuickJS dispatch.
- `crates/server/tests/protocol_e2e.rs` boots the real server on an ephemeral
  port and speaks raw TCP to verify the status ping and the login → play join
  sequence (Join Game + Chunk Data) byte-for-byte.
